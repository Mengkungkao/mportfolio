On weekends, a STEM team tutors with the YES Student Network meets grade 10 and 11 students to explore science, technology, engineering, and math through hands-on activities. Beyond experiments, the tutor guides discussions about higher education pathways, helping students understand university options, career opportunities, and how STEM studies connect to real-world problems. These sessions inspire students to think about their future studies and encourage them to pursue fields that match their interests and strengths.
