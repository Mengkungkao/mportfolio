## 1. Introduction  
 


## 5. Cable Sizing & Voltage Drop

### 5.1 Cable Sizing  
- Based on **IEC 60287** (current capacity) and **voltage drop** calculations.  
- Factors considered: load current, length of run, ambient temperature, grouping.  

### 5.2 Voltage Drop
Based on **IEC 60287 Voltage drop** is limit by 5%.

**Formula for voltage drop of phase to phase/phase to neutral:**  
```math
Delta_V_{drop} = 2 × Ib × (Rcosφ + Xsinφ) × L
```

**Formula for voltage drop of balanced 3-phase:**  
```math
Delta_V_{drop} = sqrt(3) × Ib × (Rcosφ + Xsinφ) × L
```

## 6. Miniature Circuit Breaker Selection

For the three-phase low-voltage medical system, MCBs protect against **overcurrent and short circuits**.
